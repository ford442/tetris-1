Tetris
------

The game itself should need no explanation. To compile, you need GTK 3.0
(including development headers) installed. For graphing you need gnuplot.

Some important settings can be controlled in the source file tetris.c itself,
TICK enables oder disables automatic block falling, G_WIDTH and G_HEIGHT control
the size of the game grid (in blocks).

The plotting script creates to graphs, the "valuation" of a the grid situation
(lower is better) and the number of lines consumed (after each move).
