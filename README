Tetris
------

The game itself should need no explanation. To compile, you need either GTK 3.0
or SDl 2.0 (including development headers) installed. For graphing you need
gnuplot.

Some important settings can be controlled in the main header file tetris.h:
TICK enables oder disables automatic block falling. G_WIDTH and G_HEIGHT
control the size of the game grid (in blocks). H_WIDTH and W_HEIGHT control the
resolution of the game window (SDL version only).

The plotting script creates to graphs, the "valuation" of a the grid situation
(lower is better) and the number of lines consumed (after each move).
